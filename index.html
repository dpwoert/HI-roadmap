				<p>This timeline and future roadmap is made as an assignment for Hyper Island.  My purpose of this tool is learning more about how to use data in story telling. I tried to use data to create a more hyper-textual story. This tool shows the recent history and development of passenger transport. The story is still mainly based on traditional sources but I tried to use data to make a more interactive and in-depth story. I like users to play with this story. This project is made within 3 weeks as a small experiment, so mind the bugs. <span class="info__text__name">- Davey van der Woert</span></p>

					Before the Suez canal was opened ships had to go round the southern tip of Africa to go to the East Indies and Australia, this journey was <span class="number">6,100 km</span> longer than the new route via the Suez Canal <a target="_blank" href="http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/sc.aspx?show=11" title="Suez Canal Authority.

Steamships were burned by the reliance on coal, the further it travel the more space it needs on board to store this coal. This made steamships more expansive than sailing vessels for long distance travels. Since sailing vessels had to use a tug to get through the canal, which was difficult and more expensive than going via Cape of Good Hope, the Suez canal was mainly used by steamships <span class="cite" title="Sichko, C.

					The Airbus A380 still is the biggest passenger airline on the market, it can took 550-800 passengers on every trip. The A380 is built around the assumption that airlines will continue to fly smaller planes on shorter routes (spokes) into a few large hubs, then onward to the next hub on giant airplanes. Boeing on the other hand puts his bet on the Point-to-Point model, hereby flights are flown more frequently, on smaller airplanes. The new Boeing 787 (â€˜Dreamlinerâ€™) offers a very different take on the flying experience. Focusing on comfort rather than perks that could be eliminated by airlines: more standing headroom, larger windows and bathrooms, and higher humidity. These features will benefit passengers regardless of seat configuration <a title="Babej, M. and Pollak, T. (2006). Boeing Versus Airbus.

					Uber start offering taxi services in San Francisco. When the Uber beta started in San Francisco it was only possible to order limousines (UberXL).

				<div class="timeline__content timeline__uber-network">
					Shortly after the first releases of self driving cars, Uber will start using them in cities where they are legal. Uber sees the driver as an unwanted and costly expense, stating Uber CEO Travis Kalanick: â€œWhen there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle." <a class="cite" title="Newton, C.

				<div class="timeline__content timeline__global-uber-network">
					Uber will start connecting all their hubs to form one giant network. Like in the past, new transportation network will first start locally and will later be connected to form a giant network. To connect their network Uber will buy a major airline company, and starts to connect their biggest hubs to the network. Uber wonâ€™t be the cheapest player in the market but they will be the easiest, quickest and luxurious one.

				<div class="timeline__content timeline__silent-supersonic">
					The main reason for the abandonment of supersonic flights was the cost of maintaining the fleet of concordes and the fact that a concorde can only go supersonic above the ocean. This is due to the noises and shock wave it generates when going faster than sound (mach 1). NASA is restarting their research into supersonic airplanes with â€˜project quesstâ€™ <a class="cite" title="NASA. (2016). NASA Begins Work to Build a Quieter Supersonic Passenger Jet. [online]" target="_blank" href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-begins-work-to-build-a-quieter-supersonic-passenger-jet">(NASA, 2016)</a> with the intention of making them less noisy, so they can safely be used over land as well. To prove that the next generation of supersonic airliners are safe for use over land, the first flight will go from New York to San Francisco.

				<div class="timeline__content timeline__self-driving-busses">
					It will take a while longer for busses to be driver free, it will take more legislation changes than the self driving passenger car. The form of the bus will probably change. The human driver was a bottleneck for the bus. Busses can now be smaller, while still being profitable. They can also be longer, a computer is better capable of maneuvering a long object through the streets. This means that the train of the future, could be a bus.

				<div class="timeline__content timeline__car-ownership">
					People no longer see the need for having a car. Only <span class="number">20%</span> of America will own a car, while currently <span class="number">43%</span> owns a car <a title="Hars, A.

Car ownership will be impractical in cities, it takes expansive space while your car for most part of the day is not being used. The car will therefore become a rural vehicle, connecting parts of the world that are less connected to transportation hubs. The future of ownership will therefore be usership.

				<div class="timeline__content timeline__singapore-smart-highways">
					Previous oil crises have shown that we can no longer be reliable on oil for transportation. This gave rise to more efficient cars and finally we got rid of the combustion engine in cars. These electric cars have one major disadvantage, they need batteries to move. Batteries need recharging, which limits their distance. On the other side we canâ€™t save the green energies from sun and wind. The supply of those energy sources are not consistent, therefore not reliable enough to use as our only power supply. We will still need backup power sources, unless we are using all those batteries inside of electric vehicles as one giant battery. Singapore will be the first one to replace all their roads with these smart roads.

Unlike Virgin Galactic, the SpaceLiner can take up to <span class="number">100 passengers</span> and will therefore be able to drop the prices low enough to be seen as a new method of transport. Virgin Galactic was only for entertainment, SpaceLiner will be able to get travellers from A to B.

				<div class="timeline__content timeline__end">
					Travel innovations have mostly come from serving the needs of the rich and manous at first, while later becoming available in a cheaper and less luxurious form for the middle and lower class. Travel really started when people started migrating from Europe. International traveling is something entwined with Western capitalism, people migrate to chase their dreams, go on a business trip or just go on vacation to an exotic island. On the map you can clearly see most innovations happened in the Western part of the world. You can see a shift from London as the most important part of the world, to San Francisco taking over in the digital age.
