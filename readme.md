# Hyper Island: Getting closing together (paper)
This timeline and future roadmap is made as an assignment for Hyper Island. My purpose of this tool is learning more about how to use data in story telling. I tried to use data to create a more hyper-textual story. This tool shows the recent history and development of passenger transport. The story is still mainly based on traditional sources but I tried to use data to make a more interactive and in-depth story. I like users to play with this story. This project is made within 3 weeks as a small experiment, so mind the bugs.
